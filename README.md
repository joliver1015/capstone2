# MyVGList

An app for finding information on games across 24 different platforms and 15 genres. Users are able to create and share a list of games they have played with the ability to rate them on a scale of 1 to 10. The app tracks these scores and ranks games based on an average of the game's scores. Users are also able to post reviews about a game to share their thoughts about it.

This app was created using flask for the backend and jinja2 for the frontend. Postgres was used to create the database.
